            <p class="kagulat def" id="first">I am Nathan Anicete and my life began with my wonderful parents on July 6, 2008 at Our Lady of Rosary Hospital in Macabebe, Pampanga.</p>

            <p class="kagulat def" id="second">I am in my kinder life here and from here onwards I was consistent at being in top 10.</p>

            <p class="kagulat def" id="third"> This was our Christmas Party, I spent this time with some of my friends in the picture and some other friends that are not in the picture because I can't find one. I also spent this time with my family after the event.</p>

            <p class="kagulat def" id="fourth"> This was me with my brother when I was 5 years old and at Christmas Eve. I am handsome ever since, I know. I still remember that white Christmas tree in the background because it was the last Christmas tree that is still fresh in my mind since I was a kid.</p>

            <h2 class="kagulat def" id="fifth">Long story short... 5 years later.</h2>

            <p class="kagulat def" id="sixth">This is us when I was in Grade 5 and my very first time going to a private school and stopped me from being a academic achiever, which is for me the Colegio De San Lorenzo De Pampanga. This is where most of my friends came from. They we're very great to me and they we're the ones who helped me enjoy my childhood and teenhood.</p>

            <p class="kagulat" id="seventh">This is me when I was on 6th grade, this was the first competition I joined in CDSL and guess what? I won the title "Little Mr. UN 2018," galing ko sheeshh.</p>

            <p class="kagulat long time crush ko to i am thankful hehe" id="eightth">But then.... Global Pandemic ruled the world for months and months. A ECQ that is expected for just a few weeks but lasts for a year and a half. That's the time where I met my online friends particularly from Mobile Legends and Call Of Duty: Mobile, this was also the time when I decided to learn programming out of boredom. In this time frame I was always bored, doesn't have any body exercises since we are not allowed to go outside. But, in a way, I was thankful to this ECQ, if it did not happen I think I am not comfortable around my relatives, because they were the ones who help me get through that time. And the Online Classes are pains in my head but, there was this one girl who encourage me to work hard on my grades.. HAHAHAHAH</p>

            <p class="kagulat" id="ninth">After that pandemic, grade 9 starts, I have made 4 very good friends Jobaldene, Clarence, Paul, and Hanz, they are my one call aways. One time we slept at 5 am because we are making our project for ap. But it did not turn out good. </p>

            <p class="kagulat" id="tenth">This was also in 9th grade, 4th Quarter, my first theatre, because grades 7 and 8 are held in online classes, that is why we haven't done any theatre in those times. I was the Romeo here in Romeo and Juliet.</p>

    <p class="kagulat" id="eleventh">Sooooo.... now Im in grade 10, preparing myself to have more responsibilites in the future.  There are many chances that I've wasted but now I'm trying my best to make up for them. Im still a kid growing into a man but, I have made some things in the field of programming, some of them are Frontend of our website for our movie "Ikaw at Ikaw" and few bots in discord, I think i won't pursue programming because my heart is telling me that I should be a doctor to carry the legacies of my uncles and aunties. This is the end of my autobiography. - Nathan Anicete Pogi</p>
